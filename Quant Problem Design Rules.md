**Quant Problem Design Rules:**

In the context of Multi-Agent Problem Generation, "Quant Problem Design Rules" are the strict constraints and logical heuristics programmed into the agents (specifically the Generator and Critic agents) to ensure that the mathematical or coding problems they create are valid, solvable, and high-quality.

Because Large Language Models (LLMs) are probabilistic (they predict the next word), they are prone to "hallucinating" math that looks correct but is logically flawed. The Design Rules are the "laws" the agents must follow to prevent this
